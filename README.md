## Problems encountered
My biggest setback was setting up my vscode for this project. After downloading all the necessary libraries needed, I wasn't able to access them and after some help, this issue was fixed by simply changing from python3.12 to python3.9.6

After this, it was a matter of coding the game and implementing the NEAT algorithm. I found it quite tricky to implement as it was completely new to me (the official documentation on NEAT helped a lot). I also encountered some problems with generating the pipes in the correct positions and spent a lot of time on the collision part.
